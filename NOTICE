This project is heavily based on Jetbrains' Commit Status Publisher plugin
at https://github.com/JetBrains/commit-status-publisher starting with
revision https://github.com/JetBrains/commit-status-publisher/commit/3b05e3b3a36b5375c5c785ff6c316f01aeaa9093.
The source code has been heavily modified, so we decided to update the license headers.
Please note that credits go to the original authors for the source code and architecture
still being used in this project.
